### LVs predict drug-disease pairs better than single genes

We assessed the ability of substituting latent variables (LVs) for individual genes to predict established treatment-disease relationships.
Transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations from LINCS L1000 were analyzed [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] and mapped to DrugBank IDs for further analysis [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1068; @doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47223].
A drug repurposing strategy based on reversed transcriptome patterns was applied, utilizing an established framework that uses imputed transcriptomes from TWAS to prioritize drug candidates [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.3002648; @doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.3001318; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618].
A drug-disease score was computed by calculating the negative dot product between $z$-scores for a disease (from TWAS) and a drug (from LINCS) across different gene sets.
A high score indicated potential treatment efficacy based on the regulation of disease-associated genes by the drug.
We also projected drug expression profiles into our latent representation to assess how pharmacological perturbations affected gene module activity (Figure 1b).
Prediction performance was evaluated using a gold standard set of drug-disease medical indications for 322 drugs across 53 diseases [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47664].

It is important to note that the gene-trait associations and drug-induced expression profiles projected into the latent space provide a condensed summary of the results.
The LV-based method outperformed the gene-based method, with an area under the curve of 0.632 and an average precision of 0.858 (Figure 1).
The prediction results indicate that this low-dimensional space captures biologically relevant patterns linking pathophysiological processes with drug mechanisms.


We investigated the biological plausibility of the LVs driving the prediction for a specific drug-disease pair involving nicotinic acid (niacin), a B vitamin commonly used to treat lipid disorders.
Niacin's mechanisms of action are not fully understood but are known to include increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels by inhibiting an HDL catabolism receptor in the liver and decreasing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) production by inhibiting diacylglycerol acyltransferaseâ€“2 (DGAT2).
Our analysis identified niacin as a potential therapeutic drug for coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis (AT), with scores above the mean in both gene-based and LV-based approaches.
Specifically, LV246, associated with plasma lipids and high cholesterol and expressed in adipose tissue and liver, was crucial in predicting niacin as a therapeutic drug for AT.
This LV was also significant in the prediction of other cardiovascular diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease and high cholesterol.

Analysis of top niacin-contributing latent variables (LVs) in various cardiovascular diseases revealed additional mechanisms of action.
For instance, the *GPR109A/HCAR2* gene, encoding a high-affinity niacin receptor, plays a crucial role in adipocytes and immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells.
Previous assumptions regarding niacin's antiatherogenic effects were centered on its impact on adipose tissue lipolysis inhibition.
However, recent studies have shown that nicotinic acid can independently reduce atherosclerosis progression by activating *GPR109A* in immune cells, thereby enhancing anti-inflammatory processes.
The activation of GPR109A in Langerhans cells has also been linked to the flushing side effect associated with niacin.
The cell types expressing the top-contributing modules, like LV116 and LV931, provide insights into these alternative mechanisms.
These modules show a strong immune response signature in monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, among others (Figures @fig:lv116:cell_types and @fig:sup:lv931, and Tables @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv116 and @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv931).
For example, LV116's genes exhibit immune response patterns under various stimuli, such as infections with different pathogens, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or viral infections like herpes simplex, West Nile virus, and *Salmonella typhimurium*.
These three LVs (LV246, LV116, and LV931) rank among the top 20 modules contributing to niacin prediction across diverse cardiovascular traits (Table @tbl:niacin:cardio:top_lvs).

In addition to cardiovascular traits, there are other LVs that could enhance our knowledge of niacin's mechanisms.
For instance, LV66, a top LV influenced by niacin (Figure 1), showed predominant expression in ovarian granulosa cells.
Recent research has suggested niacin as a potential therapy for ovarian diseases, as it has been shown to stimulate follicle growth and prevent granulosa cell apoptosis in animal studies (Smith et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2020).
