### PhenoPLIER: an integration framework based on gene co-expression patterns

![
**Schematic of the PhenoPLIER framework.**
**a)** High-level schematic of PhenoPLIER (a gene module-based method) in the context of TWAS (single-gene) and GWAS (single-variant).
In GWAS, we identify variants associated with traits.
In TWAS, first, we identify variants that are associated with gene expression levels (eQTLs); then, prediction models based on eQTLs are used to impute gene expression, which is used to compute gene-trait associations.
Resources such as LINCS L1000 provide information about how a drug perturbs gene expression; at the bottom-right corner, we show how a drug downregulates two genes (A and C).
In PhenoPLIER, these data types are integrated using groups of genes co-expressed across one or more conditions (such as cell types) that we call gene modules or latent variables/LVs. Created with BioRender.com.
**b)** The integration process in PhenoPLIER uses low-dimensional representations (matrices $\mathbf{Z}$ and $\mathbf{B}$) learned from large gene expression datasets (top).
We used gene-drug information $\mathbf{L}$ from LINCS L1000 and gene-trait associations $\mathbf{M}$ from TWAS: PhenomeXcan was used as the discovery cohort, and eMERGE as replication (middle).
PhenoPLIER provides three computational components (bottom):
1) an LV-based regression model that associates an LV $j$ ($\mathbf{Z}_j$) with a trait $i$ ($\mathbf{M}_i$),
2) a clustering framework that learns groups of traits from TWAS associations projected into the LV space ($\hat{\mathbf{M}}$),
and 3) an LV-based drug repurposing approach that uses the projection of TWAS ($\hat{\mathbf{M}}$) and LINCS L1000 ($\hat{\mathbf{L}}$) into the LV space.
**c)** Genes that are part of LV603, termed as a neutrophil signature [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003], were expressed in relevant cell types (top), with 53 independent samples expressed in Neutrophils, 59 in Granulocytes, and 20 in Whole blood, 56 in PBMC, 8 in mDCs, 29 in Monocytes, and 5 in Epithelial cells (the boxplot shows the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles while the whiskers extend to the minimum/maximum values).
LV603 was associated in PhenoPLIER with neutrophil counts and other white blood cells (bottom, showing the top 10 traits for LV603 after projecting gene-trait associations in PhenomeXcan).

PhenoPLIER is a computational framework that combines gene-trait and gene-drug associations with gene modules expressed in specific contexts.
The approach utilizes a latent representation derived from a large gene expression compendium to integrate TWAS with drug-induced transcriptional responses for a joint analysis.
The three main components include an LV-based regression model to compute an association between an LV and a trait, a clustering framework to learn groups of traits with shared transcriptomic properties, and an LV-based drug repurposing approach that links diseases to potential treatments.
Extensive simulations were performed for the regression model and clustering framework to ensure proper calibration and expected results under a model of no association.


TWAS results from PhenomeXcan and the eMERGE network were utilized as discovery and replication cohorts, respectively.
PhenomeXcan offers gene-trait associations for 4,091 diseases and traits from the UK Biobank and other studies, while eMERGE analyzed 309 phecodes.
TWAS results were obtained using two statistical methods: Summary-MultiXcan (S-MultiXcan) for regression and clustering, and Summary-PrediXcan (S-PrediXcan) for drug repurposing.
Colocalization results were also considered to assess overlap between GWAS and eQTL signals.
The drug repurposing strategy involved analyzing transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations from LINCS L1000, which included 1,170 compounds.


The latent gene expression representation was obtained from the MultiPLIER models, which were derived by applying a matrix factorization method (the pathway-level information extractor or PLIER) to recount2 - a uniformly-curated collection of transcript-level gene expression quantified by RNA-seq in a large, diverse set of samples collected across a range of disease states, cell types differentiation stages, and various stimuli.
The MultiPLIER models extracted 987 latent variables (LVs) by optimizing data reconstruction and aligning LVs with prior knowledge and pathways.


Each latent variable (LV) or gene module represents a group of genes expressed together in the same tissues and cell types.
LVs likely represent genes regulated by the same transcriptional program, allowing for a better understanding of genetic associations and drug mechanisms.
PhenoPLIER converts gene associations to an LV score by multiplying gene effect sizes for a trait or drug by the LV genes' weights and summing the values.
This process connects different traits and drugs to functionally-related gene groups or LVs.
PhenoPLIER also utilizes LV annotations to specify conditions where the genes are expressed, enhancing result interpretability.
MultiPLIER's models link LVs to samples with experimental conditions annotations.
For example, LV603 was associated with a neutrophil pathway and correlated with neutrophil count estimates.
Analysis with PhenoPLIER revealed that neutrophil counts and white blood cell traits ranked highly among associated traits, and basophils count and percentage were significantly linked to LV603.
Additionally, LV603's genes were expressed in relevant cell types.
These findings suggest that groups of co-expressed genes correspond to trait-associated genes, linking transcriptional mechanisms to complex traits.


PhenoPLIER enables users to investigate if disease-associated genes are part of modules expressed in specific tissues and cell types.
These cell type-specific modules may be linked to various diseases, illustrating a concept of "network pleiotropy" from an omnigenic perspective.
Additionally, it can identify a subset of genes within modules that directly impact traits, serving as potential core genes and better candidate targets.
Furthermore, PhenoPLIER can identify drugs that affect these transcriptional mechanisms, providing insights into potential mechanisms of action.
