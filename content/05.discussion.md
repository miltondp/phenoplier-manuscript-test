## Discussion

Our research paper titled 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' introduces a novel computational strategy that integrates statistical associations from Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) with groups of genes (gene modules) that have similar expression patterns across the same cell types.
The key innovation of our approach is the projection of gene-trait associations through a latent representation derived not only from measures of normal tissue but also from cell types under various stimuli and at different developmental stages.
This method enhances interpretation by moving beyond statistical associations to infer cell type-specific features of complex phenotypes.
Our approach successfully identifies disease-relevant cell types from summary statistics, and several disease-associated gene modules were replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) database.
By utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that our gene module-based approach can prioritize causal genes even in cases where single gene associations are not detected.
We interpret these results through an omnigenic perspective that distinguishes between "core" and "peripheral" genes, indicating that our approach can pinpoint genes that directly influence the trait without being regulated by other genes.
This ability allows us to prioritize alternative and potentially more attractive therapeutic targets.


The academic paper titled 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' explores the use of genetic studies and functional genomics to identify therapeutic targets and potential drug repurposing opportunities by clustering complex traits.
The research question addressed in this study is how gene expression patterns can be used to project genetic associations and highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. 

The proposed solution involves integrating drug-induced transcriptional profiles with gene modules to connect diseases, drugs, and cell types.
The study demonstrates that the latent variable (LV)-based drug-repurposing approach is more effective than the gene-based approach in predicting drug-disease links for 322 drugs across 53 diseases.
In addition to statistical prediction, the research focuses on cardiovascular traits and specifically examines the drug niacin to illustrate how the approach can connect pathophysiological processes with known mechanisms of action in adipose tissue, immune cells, and ovarian granulosa cells.

The LV-based approach presented in the paper has the potential to generate novel hypotheses for evaluating potential mechanisms of action or adverse effects of known or experimental drugs.
This research provides valuable insights into the connections between genetic associations, gene expression patterns, disease etiology, and drug mechanisms.


Our research aimed to project genetic associations through gene expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
We utilized a cluster analysis approach to identify latent variables (LVs) that were most discriminative for each cluster of diseases and traits.
Some LVs aligned with known pathways, while others, like LV57, may represent novel disease-relevant mechanisms.
Associations with cell type marker genes provided insight into potentially causal cell types for specific phenotypes.
We observed modules expressed in specific tissues, such as adipose or ovary, as well as those expressed in multiple contexts capturing pathways associated with complex diseases.
For example, LV136 was associated with cardiovascular disease and corneal biomechanics, expressed in various cell types.
Other examples include LV844, expressed in whole blood samples and associated with autoimmune diseases, and LV57, expressed in T cells and associated with autoimmune and venous thromboembolism.
This approach of projecting through learned representations from distinct datasets is a novel and computationally simple method to identify cell type and pathway effects on complex phenotypes.


The research problem addressed in the academic paper titled 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' is how to effectively project genetic associations through gene expression patterns to better understand disease etiology and identify potential therapeutic targets.
The proposed solution involves utilizing clustering trees to group phenotypes based on latent variable associations, providing a multi-resolution approach to identifying shared biological processes between complex diseases.
Hard-partitioning algorithms are employed to ensure that each trait is assigned exclusively to one cluster, taking into account all gene modules.
It is acknowledged that some complex diseases may only share a few biological processes rather than being similar across the board.
The study's TWAS results were obtained from a diverse set of GWAS with varying sample sizes and qualities, necessitating careful data preprocessing to minimize bias.
Previous research has shown that considering groups of related diseases can enhance the detection of shared genetic etiology, and clustering trees offer a method to explore these relationships within the context of latent variables.


We developed an LV-based regression framework to determine if gene modules are linked to a trait using TWAS $p$-values.
PhenomeXcan served as our discovery cohort for over four thousand traits, with many LV-trait associations replicating in eMERGE.
In PhenomeXcan, we identified 3,450 significant LV-trait associations (FDR < 0.05) involving 686 LVs (out of 987) associated with at least one trait and 1,176 traits associated with at least one LV.
In eMERGE, we discovered 196 significant LV-trait associations, with 116 LVs associated with at least one trait/phecode and 81 traits with at least one LV.
While we focused on specific disease types within our trait clusters, the full set of associations across other disease domains can be found in our [Github repository](https://github.com/greenelab/phenoplier) for future research.
As mentioned in [Methods](#sec:methods:reg), a limitation of the regression approach is that gene-gene correlations are only approximately accurate, potentially leading to false positives if the correlation among the top genes in a module is not precisely captured.
However, the regression model is reasonably well-calibrated, and we did not observe inflation when applying the method to real data.


Our research aims to explore genetic associations by analyzing gene expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and potential drug mechanisms.
We hypothesize that gene modules with coordinated expression patterns may exhibit similar pathological effects.
To address this, we have integrated two approaches in our study.
The first approach involves MultiPLIER, which extracts latent variables from large expression datasets.
These latent variables could represent real transcriptional processes or technical factors, such as "batch effects." While we utilized a model derived from recount2, originally designed for rare disorders, it may not be the most optimal representation for the diverse range of complex diseases under consideration.
Moreover, the linear combinations of variables in the underlying factorization method may overlook crucial and intricate co-expression patterns.
Although recount2, the training dataset used, has been surpassed in size and scale by other resources, our models impose minimal assumptions on the latent expression representation, allowing for potential substitution with similar approaches like GenomicSuperSignature.
The second approach employed in our study is TWAS, which focuses on the hypothesis that GWAS loci influence traits through changes in gene expression.
However, TWAS has limitations that can lead to false positives, such as identifying multiple genes within the same locus due to shared GWAS variants in gene expression models or correlated expression of nearby genes.
Despite these challenges, our LV-based regression framework effectively addresses gene-gene correlations in TWAS.


Our research problem focuses on the need to prioritize disease-treatment pairs based on genetic associations and gene expression patterns.
The question we aim to answer is how projecting association results through latent variables can improve the prioritization process compared to considering single-gene effects alone.
The proposed solution involves using latent variables to better prioritize disease-treatment pairs, as these variables represent interpretable genetic features that can provide insights into potential mechanisms of action.
Our findings align with previous studies demonstrating that drugs with genetic support are more likely to succeed in the drug development pipeline.
One challenge we face is selecting the most appropriate tissue model from TWAS to identify reversed transcriptome patterns between genes and drug-induced perturbations.


The research problem addressed in this paper is how to project genetic associations through gene expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
The proposed solution involves using a representation derived from a factorization of bulk RNA-seq data.
To improve the quality and interpretability of these representations, detailed perturbation datasets and single-cell profiling of tissues, with and without perturbagens, at various stages of development are necessary.
Furthermore, the interpretability of the representations is enhanced by annotating sample metadata.
New approaches for inferring and annotating structured metadata show promise and can be directly applied to existing data [@doi:10.1101/2021.05.10.443525].
The rapid improvements in both representation quality and interpretability set the stage for the widespread application of latent variable projections to unravel the genetic basis of complex human phenotypes.
This method offers a new perspective for mechanistic understanding of statistical associations from TWAS and can generate testable hypotheses for the post-GWAS functional characterization of complex diseases, which is likely to be of great importance in the future.
