The results of this study will help stitch together a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors influencing various health conditions.

The Phase III of the eMERGE Network was initiated and funded by the NHGRI through the following grants: U01 HG8657 (Group Health Cooperative/University of Washington); U01 HG8685 (Brigham and Womens Hospital); U01 HG8672 (Vanderbilt University Medical Center); U01 HG8666 (Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center); U01 HG6379 (Mayo Clinic); U01 HG8679 (Geisinger Clinic); U01 HG8680 (Columbia University Health Sciences); U01 HG8684 (Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia); U01 HG8673 (Northwestern University); U01 HG8701 (Vanderbilt University Medical Center serving as the Coordinating Center); U01 HG8676 (Partners Healthcare/Broad Institute); U01 HG8664 (Baylor College of Medicine).
The collaboration between these institutions served to stitch together a comprehensive approach to genomic research.

The Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) is a crucial component of research at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, made possible by a generous gift from the Smilow family and funding from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under CTSA Award Number UL1TR001878.
We are grateful to D.
Birtwell, H.
Williams, P.
Baumann, and M.
Risman for their invaluable informatics support in managing the PMBB data.
Additionally, we extend our thanks to the dedicated staff at the Regeneron Genetics Center for their role in conducting whole-exome sequencing of DNA from PMBB participants, helping to stitch together the intricate genetic fabric of our research.
