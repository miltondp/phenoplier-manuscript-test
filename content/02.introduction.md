## Introduction

Genes collaborate in specific networks to carry out various functions.
Changes in these genes can alter their function and impact disease-related biological processes.
Understanding how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different cell types, leading to improved treatments.
Previous studies have identified regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects on gene expression across various tissues.
Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has enhanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that, when disrupted, often result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.


With the abundance of gene expression data available in various tissues, an effective method to uncover biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS).
TWAS combines expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for GWAS findings.
This approach examines whether changes in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variations and human diseases.
Such strategies have proven successful in elucidating disease origins at the transcriptome level and enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores.
Additionally, TWAS has shown promise in drug repurposing efforts.
Nonetheless, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level.


Interactions among genes are essential in current theories regarding the complexity of traits, such as the omnigenic model, which emphasizes the need for methods that can unravel disease-related mechanisms.
Gene pleiotropy, which indicates that many genes are interconnected within transcriptional networks, suggests that most genes expressed in disease-relevant cell types have an impact on the trait.
To understand these interactions, the concept of gene modules, groups of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, is utilized.
Various unsupervised approaches have been suggested to uncover these gene-gene connections by identifying gene modules through co-expression patterns.
Matrix factorization techniques like independent or principal component analysis (ICA/PCA) have been effective in this task, as they can capture local expression effects and manage module overlap.
Integrating genetic studies with gene modules extracted through unsupervised learning could enhance our comprehension of disease development and progression.


In this paper titled 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms,' we introduce PhenoPLIER, an approach that offers a gene module perspective to genetic studies.
Our method is versatile, allowing the integration of various data types into a unified representation for comprehensive analysis.
By adopting this module perspective, we can deduce how groups of functionally-related genes impact complex traits, identify shared and unique transcriptomic features among traits, and forecast the impact of pharmacological interventions on gene activity to produce their effects.
PhenoPLIER aligns gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses within a shared latent representation.
To achieve this, we combine numerous gene-trait associations (utilizing TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and drug transcriptional profiles (from LINCS L1000) into a low-dimensional space derived from extensive public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2).
Our latent representation, shaped by a matrix factorization approach, extracts gene modules with specific sparsity constraints and a preference for those aligning with established knowledge (pathways).
When mapping gene-trait associations to this simplified expression space, we find diseases significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, and hematological assays with specific blood cell types.
Additionally, our method can identify modules associated with cell types under distinct stimuli or disease conditions, leveraging models from diverse RNA-seq datasets.
We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan replicate in the eMERGE network phase III.
Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation in HepG2 cells reveals more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when known lipid metabolism genes do not reach genome-wide significance.
Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with drug mechanisms.
This enhanced drug-disease prediction indicates that modules may offer a more effective approach to examining drug-disease relationships than individual genes.
Exploring the phenotype-module space uncovers stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
In conclusion, PhenoPLIER shifts the focus from single genes to groups of genes working together in specific cell types to improve the robustness of detecting and interpreting genetic associations.
This approach can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets, even when known single gene associations are not identified.
It represents a conceptual evolution in genetic study interpretation, offering mechanistic insights to enhance the comprehension of complex diseases and their therapeutic strategies.
