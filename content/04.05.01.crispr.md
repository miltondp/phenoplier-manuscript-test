### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

In our initial experiment, we aimed to determine if genes within a disease-relevant LV could serve as potential therapeutic targets.
To achieve this, we utilized a fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 approach in the HepG2 cell line, leading to the identification of 462 genes linked to lipid regulation (detailed in the Methods section).
Subsequently, we curated two distinct gene sets with high confidence that either reduced or increased lipid levels.
The lipids-decreasing gene set comprised eight genes: BLCAP, FBXW7, INSIG2, PCYT2, PTEN, SOX9, TCF7L2, UBE2J2; while the lipids-increasing gene set included six genes: ACACA, DGAT2, HILPDA, MBTPS1, SCAP, SRPR (see Supplementary Data 2).

We analyzed all 987 LVs using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA), identifying 15 LVs nominally enriched (unadjusted *P* < 0.01) with lipid-altering gene-sets.
Among those with reliable sample metadata, LV246 showed the strongest association with the lipids-increasing gene-set, containing genes primarily co-expressed in adipose tissue.
This tissue plays a crucial role in coordinating and regulating lipid metabolism.
Gene weights for LV246 were predictive of associations with plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease across all traits in PhenomeXcan.
These associations were also replicated across 309 traits in eMERGE, where LV246 showed significant associations with hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and disorders of lipoid metabolism.


Two high-confidence genes identified in our CRISPR screening, DGAT2 and ACACA, encode enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis and were highly weighted in LV246 (Figure 1b).
Unlike other genes in LV246, DGAT2 and ACACA were not associated with cardiovascular-related traits, unlike SCD, LPL, FADS2, HMGCR, and LDLR, which were significantly associated with lipid-related traits.
This lack of association may be explained by the omnigenic theory.
Assuming that TWAS models for DGAT2 and ACACA capture all common cis-eQTLs, these genes may be considered "core" genes that directly affect traits, while other genes in LV246 may be considered "peripheral" genes that regulate them.
