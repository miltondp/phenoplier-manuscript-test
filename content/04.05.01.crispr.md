### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

In our initial experiment, we aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets within a disease-relevant gene set.
To achieve this, we conducted a CRISPR-Cas9 experiment in the HepG2 cell line, resulting in the identification of 462 genes associated with lipid regulation (detailed in the Methods section).
From this pool, we selected two high-confidence gene sets: one that decreased lipids, comprising eight genes (*BLCAP, FBXW7, INSIG2, PCYT2, PTEN, SOX9, TCF7L2, UBE2J2*), and another that increased lipids, consisting of six genes (*ACACA, DGAT2, HILPDA, MBTPS1, SCAP, SRPR*), as shown in Supplementary Data 2.

We analyzed all 987 LVs using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) and identified 15 LVs enriched with lipid-altering gene-sets (Tables 1 and 2).
LV246, the top LV associated with the lipids-increasing gene-set, contained genes mainly co-expressed in adipose tissue (Figure 1a), which regulates lipid metabolism.
Gene weights for LV246 were predictive of gene associations for plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease (Table 3, FDR < 1e-23).
These associations replicated across 309 traits in eMERGE, where LV246 was significantly associated with hypercholesterolemia (phecode: 272.11, FDR < 4e-9), hyperlipidemia (phecode: 272.1, FDR < 4e-7), and disorders of lipoid metabolism (phecode: 272, FDR < 4e-7).


Two high-confidence genes identified in our CRISPR screening, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, encode enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis and were among the highest-weighted genes of LV246.
However, unlike other genes in LV246, *DGAT2* and *ACACA* were not associated with cardiovascular-related traits.
Instead, genes such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR* showed significant associations with lipid-related traits.
The lack of association of *DGAT2* and *ACACA* could potentially be explained by the omnigenic model.
Assuming that the TWAS models for these genes capture all common *cis*-eQTLs, they may represent "core" genes that directly influence traits without regulation by other genes, while other genes in LV246 may act as "peripheral" genes that regulate them.
