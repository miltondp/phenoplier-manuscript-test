### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

In our initial experiment, we aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets within a disease-relevant LV.
To achieve this, we conducted a fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 study in the HepG2 cell line, resulting in the identification of 462 genes linked to lipid regulation.
Subsequently, we curated two distinct gene sets with high confidence: one set consisting of eight genes (*BLCAP*, *FBXW7*, *INSIG2*, *PCYT2*, *PTEN*, *SOX9*, *TCF7L2*, *UBE2J2*) associated with decreased lipid levels, and another set of six genes (*ACACA*, *DGAT2*, *HILPDA*, *MBTPS1*, *SCAP*, *SRPR*) linked to increased lipid levels (Supplementary Data 2).

We analyzed all 987 Latent Variables (LVs) using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) and identified 15 LVs nominally enriched with lipid-altering gene-sets.
Among these, LV246 showed significant association with genes mainly co-expressed in adipose tissue, known for its role in lipid metabolism regulation.
Our regression analysis across all traits in PhenomeXcan revealed that gene weights for LV246 were predictive of associations with plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease.
These associations were replicated across 309 traits in eMERGE, where LV246 was significantly linked to hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and disorders of lipoid metabolism.


Two highly significant genes identified in our CRISPR screening, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, encode enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis and were top-weighted genes in LV246 (Figure 1b).
However, unlike other genes in LV246, *DGAT2* and *ACACA* were not linked to any cardiovascular traits, unlike *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR* which were associated with lipid-related traits.
This discrepancy may be explained by the omnigenic theory.
Assuming that TWAS models for *DGAT2* and *ACACA* capture all common *cis*-eQTLs, these genes may be considered "core" genes directly impacting traits, while others in LV246 may be "peripheral" genes regulating them indirectly.
