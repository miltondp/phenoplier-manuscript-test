## Abstract {.page_break_before}

How do gene expression patterns influence complex traits and disease etiology? Traditional genetic studies have focused on individual genes, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial.
In this paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and drug data to analyze gene modules with similar expression patterns.
Our approach accurately predicts drug-disease pairs and uncovers mechanisms of action.
By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in understanding disease mechanisms and drug repurposing.
