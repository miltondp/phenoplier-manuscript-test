## Abstract {.page_break_before}

How do gene expression patterns contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms? This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
By identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
The research demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
Additionally, the study shows that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes can provide valuable insights into genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
