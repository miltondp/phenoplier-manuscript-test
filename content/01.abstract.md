## Abstract {.page_break_before}

How do genes interact to influence complex traits and how can this knowledge be used to develop new therapies? While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease development.
In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data to analyze gene expression patterns across different conditions.
Our approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression profiles, revealing associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers mechanisms of action.
By analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes within trait-associated modules.
This method, which considers groups of co-expressed genes, provides a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and potential therapeutic targets compared to single-gene strategies.
