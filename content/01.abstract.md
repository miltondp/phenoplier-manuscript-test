## Abstract {.page_break_before}

How do gene-gene interactions influence the origin and progression of complex traits in disease? We propose PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.
This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
Our study highlights the importance of gene-gene interactions in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, emphasizing the need for functional genomics in genetic studies.
